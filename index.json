Linear theory with a spectral representation of topography is typically used to inform parameterisations of lee wave generation. Here, we use a realistic wave resolving simulation of the Drake Passage, a hot-spot of lee wave generation, to investigate the utility of such parameterisations for areas of complex large scale topography. The flow is often blocked and split by large amplitude topographic features, creating an 'effective topography', and calling into question the spectral representation of small scale topography for lee wave generation. By comparing the resolved modelled wave field to parameterisations employing various representations of topography, we show that spectral methods may not be appropriate in areas of rough topography. We develop a simple topographic representation consisting of an ensemble of topographic peaks, which allows physical treatment of flow blocking at finite amplitude topography. This method allows better prediction of bottom vertical velocities and lee wave energy flux than spectral methods, and implies that the nature of lee waves in such regions can be misrepresented by a spectral approach to topographic representation. This leads to both an overestimate of wave energy flux and an underestimate of wave nonlinearity, with implications for the mechanisms by which lee waves break and mix in the abyssal ocean.","tags":[],"title":"The Impact of Representations of Realistic Topography on Parameterized Oceanic Lee Wave Energy Flux (2022)","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Click on the Slides button above to view the built-in slides feature.

With periods of 3-15 days and amplitudes of ~ 100 Sv in the Pacific, these oscillations have been shown to correspond to zonally integrated equatorially trapped waves forced by winds within 10 degrees N/S of the equator. Observations of dynamic height from the Tropical Atmosphere Ocean (TAO) mooring array in the equatorial Pacific also exhibit spectral peaks consistent with the dispersion relation for equatorially trapped waves. Here, we revisit the TAO observations to confirm that the amplitude of the oscillations is consistent with the simulations, supporting the modelled large amplitude MOC oscillations. We also show that the zonal structure of the frequency spectrum in both observations and simulations is predicted by changes in the baroclinic wave speed with variation in stratification across the ocean basin.","tags":[],"title":"TAO data support the existence of large high frequency variations in cross-equatorial overturning circulation, Geophysical Research Letters (2022)","type":"publication"},{"authors":["A.

While the classic marginal shear instability of Richardson number ‚àº1/4 has been considered as potentially relevant to turbulent wave breaking, its relevance to flows that are not steady parallel shear flows has been suspect. We show that shear instability is indeed relevant in the ocean interior and propose a new marginal stability paradigm that relates the stability criterion based on Richardson number to one based on the ratio of Ozmidov and Thorpe turbulence scales. The new paradigm applies to both ocean interior and boundary layer flows. This allows for accurate quantification of the transition from downwelling to upwelling zones in a recently emerged paradigm of ocean circulation. Our results help climate models more accurately calculate the mixing-driven deep ocean circulation and fluxes of tracers in the ocean interior.","tags":[],"title":"A Marginal Stability Paradigm for Shear-Induced Diapycnal Turbulent Mixing in the Ocean, Geophysical Research Letters (2022)","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Click on the Slides button above to view the built-in slides feature.
